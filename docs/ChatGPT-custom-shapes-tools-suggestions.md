     - Number of sides (for polygons)
     - Radius, edge length, or size
     - Rotation angle
     - Stroke and fill colors

#### 2. **Pattern Generator**
   - **What it does**: Combines shapes into repeating patterns or tessellations.
   - **Customizable options**:
     - Grid size (e.g., hexagonal, square, triangular)
     - Shape repetition and spacing
     - Rotation and reflection options
     - Ability to layer multiple patterns

#### 3. **Golden Ratio Tool**
   - **What it does**: Helps users apply the golden ratio in their designs.
   - **Customizable options**:
     - Draw golden rectangles, triangles, or spirals
     - Align elements to the golden ratio grid
     - Snap objects to golden proportions

#### 4. **Fractal Generator**
   - **What it does**: Allows users to create fractal-based designs.
   - **Customizable options**:
     - Base shape (e.g., triangle, square, pentagon)
     - Number of iterations
     - Scaling factor for each iteration
     - Rotation angle for fractal branches

#### 5. **Symmetry Tool**
   - **What it does**: Enables users to create symmetrical patterns easily.
   - **Customizable options**:
     - Type of symmetry: radial, mirror, or kaleidoscopic
     - Number of radial divisions
     - Dynamic preview of symmetry lines

### **Interactive and Dynamic Features**

#### 6. **Animation Tool**
   - **What it does**: Brings shapes to life with animations.
   - **Customizable options**:
     - Animate shape transformations (e.g., scaling, rotation)
     - Animate the creation of patterns step-by-step
     - Control animation speed and loop settings

#### 7. **Guide Layers**
   - **What it does**: Helps users understand the construction process with guides.
   - **Customizable options**:
     - Show/hide grid lines, snapping guides, and proportions
     - Overlay pre-designed sacred geometry templates for inspiration

#### 8. **SVG Import/Export**
   - **What it does**: Lets users bring their own designs into the tool and export their creations.
   - **Features**:
     - Import existing SVG files for customization
     - Export designs in SVG, PNG, or PDF formats

#### 9. **3D Perspective Tool**
   - **What it does**: Adds depth to flat designs by introducing 3D elements.
   - **Customizable options**:
     - Rotate and tilt shapes in 3D space
     - Add perspective grids
     - Export 3D models or 3D-rendered images
